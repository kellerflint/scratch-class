        <p>Because completion of tutorials does not necessarily reflect a student's understanding of computer science,
            students will also be tested at certain milestones or upon request to assess their actual competency with
            the material which may fall above or below the level of the projects they have completed. No time limits
            imposed.</p>

        <h1>From 0 to 1</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Student knows the basics of how the code works and can generally explain what is happening in their
                projects. (Test on 1 random program. If not, let them try one more).</li>
            <li>With minimal help (i.e. walk through directions only), students can find obvious bugs (missing move,
                empty loop, etc.). (Test up to 4 errors on two different programs. Student passes on two successful
                corrections).</li>
            <li>Can make minor additions and modifications similar to those already in program (changing speed, number
                of times repeat, simple win condition, etc.). (Test by requesting 2 simple additions to any game). </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>From 1 to 2</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Students understand and can explain the interactions between objects and control statements. (Ask them
                to explain a part of the code that uses a loop and a part that uses an if statement focusing on things
                that interact with other objects)</li>
            <li>Students should understand generic interactions and tracking such as broadcast, recieve and global
                variables. (Test by having student making a different character speak after another finishes an
                intertermiate length player action[getting object or similar]) (Test 2: add a second score for another
                sprite in the ping pong game)</li>
            <li>Students understand the movement of sprites and how to change both their relative and absolute
                locations. (Test having students move sprites to fixed locations and relative locations both
                instantly[click the move block] and as a part of game logic[in game at start or end])</li>
        </ul>
