        <p>Because completion of tutorials does not necessarily reflect a student's understanding of computer science,
            students will also be tested at certain milestones or upon request to assess their actual competency with
            the material which may fall above or below the level of the projects they have completed. No time limits
            imposed.</p>

        <h1>From 0 to 1</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Student knows the basics of how the code works and can generally explain what is happening in their
                projects. (Test on 1 random program. If not, let them try one more).</li>
            <li>With minimal help (i.e. walk through directions only), students can find obvious bugs (missing move,
                empty loop, etc.). (Test up to 4 errors on two different programs. Student passes on two successful
                corrections).</li>
            <li>Can make minor additions and modifications similar to those already in program (changing speed, number
                of times, simple win condition, etc.). (Test by requesting 2 simple additions to any game). </li>
        </ul>
